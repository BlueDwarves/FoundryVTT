This code implements Nathair's Mischief for DnD5e: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:nathairs-mischief 

Requirements:
- dnd5e, DAE, Midi-QOL, Enhanced Terrain Layer
- Import the spell
- Import Nathair's Mischievous Surge rolltables (I can't remember where I got this from, but credit to whomever put this up for everyone).
- The image, 'molasses.jpg' must be installed in the Data folder (on my system, C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data)

Usage: On the first cast, select Use Spell Slot, then on subsequent rounds, cast again without using a spell slot. 

The spell uses the Mischievous surge table to randomly select one of the four effects. The spell sets the color of the measured template, and 
in subsequent rounds, it looks for the template with this color and deletes the previous one. It then either automatically rolls the appropriate 
saving throws for the targets or creates difficult terrain.

Notes:
- Usually, the existing template is deleted as soon as concentration is broken so the delete section is only a precaution. 
- I'd like to check for the image instead of assume it's there, but I couldn't get that to work.
- As of 2022.02.14, DnD5e Drag Rule Integration module does not recognize the difficult terrain cost.
